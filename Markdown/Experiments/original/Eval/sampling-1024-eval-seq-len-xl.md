The term " jingoism " came into use to describe the widespread patriotic spirit which reached its zenith in the First World War. As this phase of British national consciousness reached its climax. it started to give way to a second, " more personal form of nationalism ", by which the British were seen as individual human beings. This nationalism was most strongly associated with the British Empire, as the common thread which held them together, not just in terms of their political power but also their historical development. In contrast, the German people were seen as unifying. It was during this period that " modern patriotism " became the overarching form of jingoism. As such, it was often used as a response to perceived attacks on the Empire such as those in Ireland. One of many examples involved the British response to a series of atrocities in Ireland, which resulted in the 1916 Rising in Ireland. It is often held that jingoism may be defined in relation to a society's " national myth ". The " national myth ", in the context of jingoism, generally refers to an image of the British Empire that is held to be truthful to its nature, being, for example, an inclusive, hom

In late 2010, the United Methodist Church ( UMC ) in the South Carolina General Conference ( SGC ) adopted a resolution that stated a person, family, group, or institution guilty of the " violation of human beings " were not to be welcome in the United Methodist church. To meet their conscience and to affirm the UMC's continued focus on human and civil rights, Rev. Charles Williams and other church leaders and activists from the Southern Baptist Convention opposed the UMC resolution. Williams, in particular, made it clear to church members during a March 2011 general conference conference ( GC ) presentation that the anti @-@ LGBTQ stance of the UMC and its member churches could destroy the church. In response, Williams and other Southern Baptist leaders published " The Church ’ s Heart ", a pamphlet that presented a positive approach that included a " pastoral defense of full LGBT human rights and a call to action ".

The original design was created in 2009 by designer and illustrator Chris Echols, inspired by artist Jack's work on his children's coloring book, " D.C. Comics ". His son, Dylan Micallef, was inspired by the book's " colorful black and white illustrations that were full of magic " and sought to " make something from his imagination that he could show all his friends and family ". Echols and his family decided to create a DC Comics mash @-@ up book about his son, as well as all comics. While his wife, Amanda Micallef, and their son, Charlie, were inspired by the story of the original creator, they wanted to create something more " whimsical " than the original by adding their own characters to the mix.

The King of Fighters is the final main entry in the series'arcade fighting game franchise, the first to be produced in the United States as part of the Street Fighter series. The game follows the same game mode as its predecessors, focusing on a party fighting between two characters, each equipped with one or two weapons, in arenas called arenas in each of the three games in the series – one story game mode, two fighting-oriented arcade adventures, and one single @-@ player event game. In all three games, there is one team leader, who takes control of the team and commands the combatants'actions on each stage ; the two remaining players ( called " characters " ) have control of the combatants'character and action, respectively, and must fight their opponents in sequence, attacking them while evading their attacks and using their own " special attacks ". Once the combatants engage the opponent in battle, the boss character, also known as " The King of Fighters ", moves closer to the arena in which the combatants are fighting and the player must defeat him and defeat the fighters on the other team to advance to the next stage.
The game was developed for the first VIC @-@ 11 computer using an early version of arcade @-@ style game.

In 2005, F-Tech created a novel and innovative new electronic circuit board, which is a highly efficient power semiconductor, called a " low power CMOS ", which is an electronic device that is able to operate at extremely low voltages, due to its extremely low inductance and capacitance. Due to its low power, the circuit board can provide better power, capacity, and performance compared to most other commercial CMOS ICs, such as the CMOSPAT.

The name " Saffron Cabbage " is derived from the Sanskrit word saffron, which meant " green ". It was first cultivated by the Persian sages in the 8th century, and by the 10th century in Central Asia and northern India. The Saffron Cabbage was first cultivated in China in the 19th century. It was later replaced in modern times by other types, including the " Cabbage Family " vegetables.
This type of cabbage was known as a " small cabbage @-@ like " ( 煮牛子, goumoushi ) before 1842, when it was discovered to be the same as the modern sweet cabbage ( Brassica napus ). The cultivation and cultivation of the Cabbage Family vegetables became increasingly important in the 20th century. Its role in the food industry has led to the production of a wide range of popular dishes such as dumplings, soups, stir @-@ fries, noodles, and other snack foods. The variety of colors of cabbage has varied over time. According to the British culinary historian Robert Lippman, in ancient Greece a cabbage or cabbage @-@ like cabbage was eaten in the form of a soup. Cabbages were usually red ( a color known by Chinese cooks of the past as " red cabbage " ( 名麻華 ) ), which were then replaced by white ( a color known by French cooks of the past as " white cabbage " ( 湯麻華 ) ) and a long, reddish @-@ yellow leaf ( a color known by Chinese cooks of the distant past as " yellow cabbage " ( 湯麻華 ) ). The original " traditional " " yellow " cabbage was replaced by the white variety later in the 20th century. Some authors report that in China in ancient times there were six different types of cabbage.
The first recorded use of Saffron ( saffraria ) in the modern world and cultivated in the Western world is the culinary use for the spice to color the vegetables in the early 19th century. It was introduced to England by German immigrants in 1719, and was used as a seasoning in soups and stews, and as a spice to color fish, eggs, and cheese. This was a popular culinary term in France until the early 19th century. It was introduced to Mexico before the first settlement

Kannada was spoken by the people of the Mambalam region of southern Karnataka, who used it for centuries, before they were conquered by the Mysore Kingdom. In the 5th century, the Indo @-@ Greek ( Indo @-@ Indic ) language became the dominant language of South Indian, while the Mysorian Kingdom of Kerala became the capital and cultural centre of the region. During that era Sanskrit became the primary language of southern Karnataka, and Kannada subsequently became the primary language of the coastal south, particularly its southern parts. After the decline of Mysore, the island of Sri Lanka was occupied by the Mysore State. The Mysore Kingdom lasted for most of the 8th century, but was eventually replaced by the Kingdom of Vijayanagar, which ruled the north @-@ east coast of the Indian subcontinent.
In the 9th century, Kannada continued to be a spoken language on the mainland, when the Vijayanagara Empire unified all the Indian subcontinent as the British and Maratha empires and ruled many states such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Bengal, Hyderabad, Mysore, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh. During the 10th century, Kannada was used throughout Karnataka. The state of Mysore had two of the six states : a large princely empire under Mauryas and Kannada at Nalanda near modern Chennai, and also a small but powerful state in the inland delta region known as the Malabar region.
On August 9 @,@ 1267, King Ramanathaswamy III of Nalanda conquered the entire Malabar region, which was then part of Vijayanagar at Malabar, then part of the Indian subcontinent. He was the founder of the Nalanda University, later known as the University of Delhi. This was the first university in the Indo @-@ Buddhist tradition in the ancient India.
Later Mysore had several local kingdoms, including the Kodaikanal kingdom near present day Ernakulam in southern Karnataka, the Sankatyapuram kingdom and the Tiruvarajar empire.
The Mysore Kingdom and the Kodaikanal kingdom became the kings of northern Karnataka. The Sankatyapuram kingdom became the kings of the Karnataka region as an independent kingdom

" The Walking Dead " was first mentioned in the script for The Walking Dead : The Complete First Season, an online game created by the creative team of The Walking Dead, although initial discussions about it pre @-@ existed in the Walking Dead game series. The idea for the game came from the studio's director of story, Robert Kirkman, which led to " A Telltale Game " being the first title to have a name given to it since the original game. The developers named the game for the character of " Walker " from the comics, who appeared on The Walking Dead in the comic series that were adapted to film and television. This game will not follow the comic storyline of The Walking Dead, although " a large number of characters " will appear in the game. It will include gameplay that will feature a similar format as the comics, although it is unclear which characters are involved in the game so far. There are a number of elements in " The Walking Dead " that will be new to the comic series. The game is created to take place during the events of The Walking Dead, but based on a different timeline of the comics. " The Walking Dead " takes place many years later in a different location than the comic, which will not be fully explained. It features various characters appearing from the comics, and more. In the comics, the character named " Lori Grimes ", " Maggie ", and " Jessie " appear on The Walking Dead.
However, the Walking Dead's executive producer and director, Glen Mazzara, stated that while it is " possible we may " make a prequel to the comic series, they are " not writing a comic book ". This was not stated as a fact, but rather in general terms. The Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman states that it is likely that the comic will be adapted later in the series. Kirkman noted that his studio will not " necessarily follow the comic canon ", stating " We've had to deal with a certain amount of mythology in our world, and we've been told not to include it. And that leaves a lot of open mysteries, " so this new game will hopefully not have the same problems as the comic. The Walking Dead will feature characters from both television series and the comic series, although not necessarily from the first.
The Walking Dead comic writer Robert Kirkman mentioned that the game will be set shortly after the events of the comic, although further down the line. It is also stated at the end of the game that " another zombie outbreak has come to the Capital City, and it's up to the surviving residents of the State to fight it off ", referring to zombies from Season 4 onwards. The game will be set in Washington, D.C. as it is the capital of the United States. Although The Walking Dead has been set in Washington, D.C., since the beginning, Season 4 introduced a new setting in the form of Atlanta, Georgia. The Walking Dead game will use " the same characters, story, and gameplay themes " as The Walking Dead television series. An executive producer for The Walking Dead wrote that, " As fans of the comic you know we want to do The Walking Dead in a way that honors the source material — the story and the characters — while also being true to the game world. " This suggests that while the series will not follow the comic storyline entirely, elements will be included that are related to the events of the TV series. On the topic of the television series, the executive producer for the TV series Robert Kirkman stated that he believes the Walking Dead comic series to be one of the best comics in history, and that the game is also one of the best. The Walking Dead game will be released in 2013 on the PlayStation Network, the Xbox Live Marketplace and Steam.

= Ayrton Senna =

Ayrton Senna was an Italian Formula 1 driver who started racing as a Formula Ford Racing driver in 1994, going on to win his first World Endurance Championship title in 1998. In addition to Formula 1, Senna was a professional motorcycle racer, also for the Peugeot team in the World Sprint Bike Championship.

= = Early life = =

Senna was born on March 2, 1973 in Pescara, Italy, the youngest of three children. He was raised by his mother in the small coastal village of Senna. When he was two and a half, his parents moved the family to the city of Genova. Ayrton graduated from the local high school, but was forced to drop out in the ninth grade since he was unable to attend the local high school due to the severe handicap of having an older brother, and also because he was having the same problems with other students in the town. He returned to his hometown in the early 1980s to live with his mother and attended Pescara's local state secondary school. His first Formula 3000 race at Magny @-@ Courcelette, which later became the first of his three wins – in 1997 – is recorded by Formula One historians as becoming the first racing victory by a disabled driver. In the same year at the same circuit he took two more victories in the 250 cc National Championship of Automobile Racing at the Zürich and Zandvoort circuits.
In 1984 Senna had a second career as a professional motorcycle racer. Senna, who could hold his own in a 250 cc class, began his career with Cessna Super Sport in Superstock racing in a series of classes where Superbike engines are legal. As Superstock drivers, Senna and Alain Brivet had to take classes with other drivers so the Supersports were able to race with better equipment, engines, and tires and this made their racing less exciting and fun ; they 'd often suffer from a number of technical problems. The year before he had won his first and only 250 cc World Championship title. The following championship's class was the Superstock class which included the Super 2000 class.
Senna was signed by Peugeot Sport for the 1994 season ; it was the first time the company had employed a disabled driver. However, he did not race in the 1995 season – due to an accident – due to the Super 2000 class being moved to Pirelli, which did not run the engines, and the Superstock class being moved to Suzuki due to the Super 2000 class's poor performance. The Suzuki Superbike team had several problems. They used the Yamaha motor that was later re @-@ developed for Honda. In addition to the problems they had with the Honda engines, they also had problems with the brakes, tires, suspension and clutch, making them a very difficult group of men to work with. The Honda engine was also different to the Honda engines that had powered the Suzuki team as Peugeot had to use its own engine, which was developed from its own design and different to what Honda had produced for the Suzuki team. However, because the Super 2000 class was so poorly attended, the lack of sponsorship or interest had the effect of making it a very difficult group of men to deal with. In a series of tests, on February 13, 1995, Senna was able to score the first win in a 250cc world title – for the Super 2000 class – in his home country in the championship's debut race in the series. He took a similar victory in his home series, the 250 cc Champi Series. Ayrton would go on to win another 250 cc World Championship title later the same year in 1998. Senna would win a total of 27 races, and his total points lead over third @-@ placed Alain Prost was 1 @,@ 081 in 250cc, or 1 @,@ 038 in 250cc World Championship races. In the Super 2000 category, which included the Super 2000 and Superstock classes and Super 3000, Senna's total winnings ran out at 1 @,@ 002 points, the most of any driver in the series. However, Senna did win the 250cc World Championship again in 1999, which included a world championship round and a Super 2000 race. His most difficult 250cc races were in the Super 300 series of the World Sprints series, where in 1996 he won his third World Championship title in four years.
Senna was born in Pescara to a family of three brothers, one sister, and one sister's child, all three of whom were handicapped. His father died when Ayrton was six. In addition, his mother's older brother, named Giancino, had died in a car accident while in his teens and his mother had been suffering from a severe blood disorder. Senna's mother, who had

A typical run of Metroid Prime is similar to a non @-@ linear platformer, in that players can advance through the game by navigating through the same locations where they last encountered them. Metroid Prime takes place in the past of an unnamed alien galaxy, between two galaxies with unknown origins. Various species of creatures called Samus Aran appear throughout the game, along with her trusty robot pet, Blast. Various events allow characters to unlock power @-@ ups, such as the ability to open chests, which enables players to get access to new areas.
Metroid Prime is similar to games such as Metroid, and Metroid II. However, while Metroid and Metroid II have Metroid's " Zebes " (, to many modern video game developers ) as the primary character, Metroid Prime is set on an unnamed planet called Aetherius, where Samus was sent to save the planet of Aether, which has been threatened by a galactic menace known as the Space Pirates. In addition to Aetherius, the player also encounters several other intergalactic destinations where the player must meet the different creatures in order to advance.
The developers of Metroid claimed to be trying to " [ provide ] a game that has as little in the way of traditional'Metroid @-@ like'exploration'elements as possible ", including the addition of power @-@ ups. Additionally, to create a more open @-@ world-oriented experience, the Gameboy versions of Metroid Prime's three levels and Metroids " are all connected by a single single open world ". According to Metroid co @-@ creator Nintendo founder Hiroshi Yamauchi, " Metroid Prime has very little'Metroid @-@ like'traversal'gameplay " ; thus, the original Metroid was the first game to achieve that style, but only by making a game that played a few meters above normal.
Metroid Prime's story features the first major male / female character relationship to exist in the series and is the first of its kind in the Metroid series. Samus and Ridley are the two main leads. Samus is human, and as such, her species is extinct and she is one of the last survivors of her species ; Ridley is a parasitic @-@ nature @-@ @-@ @ infected, genetically engineered extraterrestrial, and the only known surviving member of his species'race. Unlike the other protagonists, Ridley is not a bounty hunter, explorer, or a bounty hunter / explorer that hunts Samus, he is a bounty hunter / explorer that hunts the original Space Pirate known as Zebes, the original creator of all of the Metroids. Ridley and Samus first appear at the beginning of the Metroid Prime game's plot, after Metroid and Metroid II's storylines. After Metroid and Metroid II, Samus and Ridley first appear before the player, they are the only two male / female leads in the Metroid series. The role of the female protagonist was previously played by Bionix's heroine, Samus Aran, and is portrayed again by her in Metroid : Other M and Super Metroid. Samus and Ridley appear in the first two Metroid games, and Metroid Prime does not feature characters other than Samus and Ridley. Both characters are voiced in the English versions of Metroid and Metroid Prime, by Clancy Brown and John Leguizamo ; Brown's voice for Samus is slightly different, with a more distinct accent. Leguizamo's voice for Ridley is noticeably softer, and has a more pronounced Italian accent.
Unlike previous games in the Metroid series, Metroid Prime's levels are not linear, the player must progress through each level in a certain way and in a specific order in order to complete the game, due to the Space Pirate's intrusion into the universe's temporal structure that caused time to glitch. The level design of each level uses a central area where the player can view all of the surrounding levels, but each area is not connected until all other surrounding levels are reached. Thus, the player must move through the Metroid Prime's levels in the same order, to access their adjacent areas.
The level structure of Metroid Prime was inspired by Metroid II and the level design of Metroid II : The Return of Samus and Metroid : Other M ; Metroid Prime takes place in the same region as Metroid II, and Metroid II is set in an unknown area, which has a similar terrain as both Metroid and Metroid II. A common misconception about Metroid Prime's levels is that they are not the same scale as Metroid II. In reality, the level size was reduced for Metroid Prime, due to the limited amount of space in the original NES's RAM, with the resulting size of Metroid Prime's areas being smaller than Metroid II and Metroid : Other M. A smaller size was achieved by decreasing the number of small, easily @-@ seen areas in each level and

" Ritmo " is a blues @-@ based music piece. Cobain stated that it was based on the Robert Johnson song " Mississippi Goddam ". The song's lyrics are about the protagonist growing up to marry a woman from the South.
" Ritmo " is also a reference to a Nirvana song with the same name, which was recorded one week after the band's concert on October 7, 1990 at the Greek Theatre. It was performed by Nirvana during the band's performance of the single, " Smells Like Teen Spirit " by " On a Plain ", to which Cobain added three words : " Ritmo ". Another Nirvana song, " Pile of Bones ", was released one year later. " Pile of Bones " had taken Cobain's words from the Dylan song " Ritmo "'s title, and added some new ones, and ended up being the follow @-@ up of the single.
The cover of the track played while " On a Plain " played throughout Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain's set during an October 6, 1990 show at the Greek Theatre in Seattle, Washington, USA. It was played and sung by Courtney Love.
According to " In Utero ", Cobain's album " In Utero " includes " Ritmo ". However, he later stated that the line " Ritmo " had " all come from " Dylan ". On March 12 1991, during the first performance of " In Utero " by Nirvana, Cobain admitted " Ritmo " was a song that he had written in the control room before the concert, but that it had not been a live song. He explained that a " big problem " with the song was that it had been recorded " with a few microphones and a guitar " that added a distortion, in order to sound " livey ". He stated he had intended to change the sound of Cobain's guitar after he had finished recording it. He described his change to its current sound as " the sound of four feet in a box with a guitar under \$ 1.00 every 12 hours and a microphone set on high ". He added that the instrument used on the track had been an electric guitar. On April 30, 1991, during a performance by the band at Madison Square Garden, Cobain introduced the track " Ritmo ", but after the song played, Love's bass player Dave Grohl's guitar broke while playing a chord. After the break, Grohl returned to the stage, and performed in Cobain's place for the next two songs of the show. In the " On a Plain " show, Love joined with Grohl on some of the show's riffs, and on August 30, 1991, Love played some of the band's songs and Cobain played his guitar for Love, in an attempt to repair the guitar.

It is the first game in the series to be directed by Kondo, rather than produced by Nintendo Co., and the final installment of the series, thus making it the final game in the series. It is the first video game to be adapted for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System GameCube.
It follows Majora's Mask, one of the first games ever released in Japan, in which Link is trapped in a dream world after his death and must use his magical mask which has the power to enter that world. Majora uses a modified version of the same theme as Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, as its final boss, but with minor changes to the story and more enemies to fight, such as ghosts and cacti.

During his time on Termina, Majora, disguised as an old man, steals the Triforce from its resting place in the Temple of Time in the Hyrule Castle. Tatl, an elderly sorceress, is sent to the Sacred Realm to retrieve the Triforce in order to set the world free from eternal darkness and seal it away as she had done so many times before. However, in the end, she fails, and the Triforce is split on two paths into the realm of darkness. Link is sent into the realm of Hyrule to use the mask to enter within the world. Upon entering, Link, disguised as a child, loses his memories, and all of his previous friends and past lovers disappear. He is attacked by a creeper, but Link defeats him. The next day, Link finds his sister Navi, who had been captured by an evil group known as " Skull Kid ". The Skull Kid takes Zelda's power, leaving Link powerless and unable to help Navi. Suddenly, Majora, who is inside of its mask, appears before Link, explaining the events that led to the Triforce being split into two and allowing them to access different realms. They travel to the realm of darkness together and meet a man in a hood who tells them of Navi's fate, which he explains as the Skull Kid's master. Later in the game, Majora appears, revealing that they were sent into the dark world to obtain the power needed to bring light back to the universe.
The game is heavily influenced by the classic Japanese comic novel and film Akira. However, as the name of the game suggests, Majora's mask is a completely new design by the Japanese artist Katsuya Eguchi during his time on the Zelda team. Although some elements remain from previous Zelda games, the game features a new and unique character, Mask. In the game, Link becomes possessed by the Mask. While in this form, Link is able to break the " seal " that has been placed to protect the Triforce, and when all the other seven pieces of the Triforce are taken from the Temple of Time, the Mask can be collected as the game's eponymous Majora Mask, with the help of Deku Flowers which appear in different locations throughout the game. To obtain the mask, Link must defeat all of the creatures that live in Hyrule and to do this, Link must collect all nine Deku Flowers along with the three Ocarina Stones.
